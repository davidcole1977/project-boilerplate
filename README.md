# project-boilerplate

This is the starter boilerplate I use for my own personal web-based projects, with a simple default directory structure, example 'placeholder' files, JS libraries, and grunt tasks set up for various essentials such as unit testing, linting, compiling CSS and managing JS dependencies 

Feel free to download / fork and use as you wish.

## Release History:

### 1.0.0
* Basic directory structure set up
* file examples and grunt tasks set up, including JSHint, Mocha, Browserify, LibSass, copy, clean, watch
* Custom Grunt task 'serveStaticFiles' to spin up a very basic static dev server using Express
